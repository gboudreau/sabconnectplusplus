-------------
Improvement: Timeout for notifications (to disappear) is now configurable. Default is to keep them open indefinitely.
Improvement: Allow you to use the X-DNZB-Category HTTP header on sites that supports it (nzbs.org, Newzbin), instead of using the default auto-categorization. The X-DNZB-Category header will only contain the main category (eg. 'TV'), versus auto-categorization that will contain the full category name (eg. TV.x264) http://code.google.com/p/sabconnectplusplus/issues/detail?id=18
Improvement: Added individual 1-click NZB download buttons to nzbindex.com http://code.google.com/p/sabconnectplusplus/issues/detail?id=20

Version 0.4.2
-------------
New feature: double-click the toolbar icon to open SABnzbd.
  Note: Chrome doesn't support this natively.
  The extension tries to detect if you tried to open the popup twice fast enough, and will open SABnzbd if it detects you did.
  You might want to continue clicking on the toolbar icon until a new tab opens, if just double-clicking doesn't work for you.
Bugfix (Issue #1): one-click NZB button was missing from binsearch.net (same as binsearch.info); thanks evertbeurskens for the patch.

-------------
New feature: Added nzbindex.com 1-click NZB downloads
             Auto-categorization: 1st group that appears in "Group" column on nzbindex.com will be sent as the Category. Make sure to create categories that have names equal to the groups you usually download from (eg. a.b.sounds.mp3.french). Sorry, but there's no way I can use the SABnzbd 'group' field using the API... :\
			Bugfix: SABnzbd icons (used to send a NZB to SABnzbd) changed to 'fetching' (green arrows), but never changed to 'OK' (green logo). Cosmetic bugfix; the actual send operation worked fine.

             Auto-categorization: 1st group that appears in "Group" column on binsearch.info will be sent as the Category. Make sure to create categories that have names equal to the groups you usually download from (eg. a.b.sounds.mp3.french). Sorry, but there's no way I can use the SABnzbd 'group' field using the API... :\
New feature: Thanks to SABnzbd 0.5.3, auto-categorization for NZBMatrix.com! :)
             Documentation here: http://wiki.sabnzbd.org/configure-categories
             Example SABnzbd categories you need to create: http://cl.ly/eec6e7308ee01f800b3d
Improvement: Re-enabled the option to show a graph in popup.
